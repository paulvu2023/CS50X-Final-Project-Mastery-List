# CS50X-Final-Project-Mastery-List

#### Description:
This is a "Mastery List" web application. The term "Mastery List" was created by the wise millionaire named Luke Belmar. A mastery list is similar to a checklist, but it is much more useful and more advanced as it allows people to prioritize their tasks based on two variables. Here is how it works. First, you add multiple tasks that you want to do for the day, you rate their "ease" on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being very difficult and 10 being very easy, then you rate their "importance" on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being not very important and 10 being very important. Then it uses simple addition to perform a calculation and determines the "priority score", which is a score for which tasks you should do first. The formula is "ease" + "importance" = "priority score".

Here's an example. Let's say I have 3 tasks that I need to do. The first is working out. I choose an "ease" of 8 and an "importance" of 10. 8 + 10 = 18 so the priority score is 18. My second task is programming. I choose an "ease" of 4 and an "importance" of 10. 4 + 10 = 14 so the priority score is 14. Finally, my last task is getting some sunlight. I choose an "ease" of 10 and an "importance" of 10.  We do the tasks with the highest priority scores first, so I would go get some sunlight because it has a priority score of 20, then I would workout because it has the second highest priority score of 18, and finally i would program because it has a priority score of 14.

Some problems I encountered were connecting the front end and the backend. I did not know how to setup Flask, Python, and sqlite3 to work together so it was a huge hurdle for me. I was feeling pretty frustrated and thought about doing something else because at the time I felt like this was too hard. But, I clenched my teeth and kept on moving forward, as I looked at the notes for CS50X week 9. Not too far later, my memory was refreshed and I was able to complete my Final Project with not TOO much difficulty.

The biggest thing I learned from this project is how to use Python and Flask to build a front end.
